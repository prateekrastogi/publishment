**Bitcoin** (â‚¿) is a cryptocurrency. It is implemented as a **chain of blocks**. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. Transactions on those blocks are defined using a scripting language. Transactions consist of one or more inputs and one or more outputs.

On 31 October 2008, a link to a paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto titled <br /> *Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System* was posted to a cryptography mailing list. Nakamoto implemented the bitcoin software as open-source code and released it in January 2009.

On 3 January 2009, the bitcoin network was created when Nakamoto mined the first block of the chain, known as the *genesis block*. Embedded in this block was the text "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks".
